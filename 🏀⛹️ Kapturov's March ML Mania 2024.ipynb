The portfolio should comprise at least 1 and at most 100,000 brackets per tournament. Each bracket will be awarded points based on the number of correct predictions per tournament round: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 points for each correct prediction in rounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively.\n","\n","The score for each tournament is the average score of all of the predicted brackets for that tournament. The final score is the average of the two tournament scores.\n","\n","Each team is identified by a three character string of the form {region}{seed}, where {region} is one of 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z' and {seed} is a string of digits from 01 to 16. Note that we do not score the play-in games. We will therefore denote by W16 the winner of the game between W16a and W16b, and similarly for any other play-in teams.\n","\n","The structure of each bracket is defined by its slots. In rounds 1 to 4, each slot is identified by a four-character string of the form 'R{round}{region}{chalk_seed}'. The {chalk_seed} is the seed, from 1 to 8, of the best possible seed that could appear in that slot. For instance, R1W1. The two Final Four (Round 5) slots are R5WX and R5YZ, and the Championship (Round 6) game slot is R6CH. Each bracket must contain a prediction for every tournament slot.\n","\n","Please see the heading Data Section 5 files: MNCAATourneySlots and WNCAATourneySlots on the Data page for more on tournament slots.\n","\n","The predictions in each bracket must follow valid tournament paths. In other words, if a team is predicted to win a game in Round N, that team must have also been predicted as the winner of Round N-1 in one of the respective feeder games. The winner of a game in Round 1 must be one of the two teams scheduled to play in that game."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1b7f0ef1","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008855,"end_time":"2024-02-29T09:38:47.577438","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-29T09:38:47.568583","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <span style=\"color: white; background-image: url(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/70068/images/header); border-style: solid; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; border-width: 5px;\">Files for competition:</span>\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">Conferences.csv</span>** - Data about conferences in college basketball.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">sample_submission.csv</span>** - Sample file for submitting result forecasts.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WNCAATourneyDetailedResults.csv</span>** - Detailed results of the Women's NCAA Tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WRegularSeasonCompactResults.csv</span>** - Compact results of the Women's regular season.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MNCAATourneySeedRoundSlots.csv</span>** - Data about NCAA tournament seeding and round slots.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MRegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv</span>** - Detailed results of the Men's regular season.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MNCAATourneyCompactResults.csv</span>** - Compact results of the NCAA tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MGameCities.csv</span>** - Cities where Men's basketball games take place.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WGameCities.csv</span>** - Cities where Women's basketball games take place.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MSeasons.csv</span>** - Data about seasons in Men's basketball.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MSecondaryTourneyTeams.csv</span>** - Teams participating in the secondary NCAA tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">2024_tourney_seeds.csv</span>** - Seeding for the 2024 tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">Cities.csv</span>** - Data about cities where games are held.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MTeamSpellings.csv</span>** - Variants of team spellings.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MRegularSeasonCompactResults.csv</span>** - Compact results of the Men's regular season.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MMasseyOrdinals.csv</span>** - Massey rankings for teams.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MSecondaryTourneyCompactResults.csv</span>** - Compact results of the secondary NCAA tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WTeams.csv</span>** - Information about Women's teams.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MNCAATourneySlots.csv</span>** - Slots for the NCAA tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MNCAATourneySeeds.csv</span>** - Seeding for the NCAA tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WNCAATourneyCompactResults.csv</span>** - Compact results of the Women's NCAA tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WSeasons.csv</span>** - Data about seasons in Women's basketball.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WNCAATourneySeeds.csv</span>** - Seeding for the Women's NCAA tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MTeamCoaches.csv</span>** - Information about team coaches in Men's basketball.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MConferenceTourneyGames.csv</span>** - Results of games in conference tournaments.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WRegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv</span>** - Detailed results of the Women's regular season.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MNCAATourneyDetailedResults.csv</span>** - Detailed results of the NCAA tournament.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WTeamSpellings.csv</span>** - Variants of team spellings for Women's teams.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MTeamConferences.csv</span>** - Information about team conferences in Men's basketball.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">MTeams.csv</span>** - Information about Men's teams.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">WTeamConferences.csv</span>** - Information about team conferences in Women's basketball.\n","\n","**<span style=\"color: orange\">fivethirtyeight_ncaa_forecasts_2023.csv</span>** - FiveThirtyEight forecasts for the 2023 NCAA tournament."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"79f53312","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"papermill":{"duration":0.008164,"end_time":"2024-02-29T09:38:47.594235","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-29T09:38:47.586071","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <span style=\"background-image: url(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/70068/images/header); color: white; font-size: 50px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px\">Table of Contents</span>\n","\n","1.
