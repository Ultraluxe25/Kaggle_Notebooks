# 🧑‍🔬 Importance of Participation in Scientific Conferences for ML Engineers and Data Scientists

# 👋 Hello, dear Kagglers! I want to discuss why participating in scientific conferences is very important for machine learning engineers and data scientists.

## ✅ 1. **Staying Updated with Cutting-Edge Research**  
- During conferences, we get acquainted with new approaches and the latest achievements in various fields.
- We gain practical experience working with SOTA models to solve specific problems

## ✅ 2. **Networking and Collaborations**  
- Communicate with smart scientists and experts from various scientific fields.  
- Build connections with scientists that could lead to future collaborations, job opportunities, or partnerships in projects.  

## ✅ 3. **Building a Personal Brand**  
- Raise your self-confidence by presenting your report or article and create presenation using Canva.  
- Develop public speaking by presenting your work to a large audience of experts and participants.  

## ✅ 4. **Getting Feedback on Your Work**  
- Receive your scientific project evaluated by experts.  
- Get insightful questions and feedback to identify weak points in your article or report to improve them in the future.  

### 🧑‍🎓 My Recent Scientific conferences:
Recently, I participated in two scientific conferences. 
In one I was participator (**Youth in Science 2024**)
 and in second I was a member of the jury at a scientific conference for schoolchildren.
**My talk was about using the family of YOLO models to recognize human gestures.**
